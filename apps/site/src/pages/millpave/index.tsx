						The way we sell at Millennium is pretty old school.

					<p>
						Prospects have to visit or call in to find out basic information
						about our products. We have to phone or email customers just to send
						them notifications. And we still whip out calculators to invoice
						projects â€” even when millions are on the table.
					</p>
					<p className="font-display text-lg font-semibold">
						As the status quo, this hurts customer experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						It creates an unnecessary barrier between customers and the company.
						And it slows down the team with lots of simple yet repetitive work.

						But what if it could be different?
